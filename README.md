# Impossible App

An app that reads my finger print and gauges my mood and then lists projects that I am currently undertaking based on how well I am currently suited to work on the projects as well as the projects themselves.  For example, my current mood could be creative, but lazy, so the app displays a 94% productivity rate for creative writing projects and a 5% productivity rating for washing my truck.
